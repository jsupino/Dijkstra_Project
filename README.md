Using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, a Python program is implemented that computes the shortest distance of an undirected weighted graph, as shown in Figure 1.
Once the algorithm executes, the shortest path will be returned. This identifies the shortest path from New Jersey to Colorado and how mnay hours it will take.

***Input:*** The following graph is inputted using 12 different states and their associated edges and weights between two states.

    *Figure 1.* The nodes (0-11) represent 12 different states. The edges represent the number of hours from the middle of each state to the next. The nodes represent the states, as shown in the key. The weights represent the number of hours to get from the middle of one state to the middle of the next.
    
   *Key.* The key identifies each state that corresponds to each node.

***Output:*** The shortest distance, or minimum number of hours, from New Jersey to Colorado is approximately 31 hours. The shortest path from New Jersey to Colorado is New Jersey to Pennsylvania to Ohio to Indiana to Illinois to Iowa to Nebraska and finally to Colorado.
